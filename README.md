# üó∫ Robinson's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Here, I document a summary of my projects in the data field.

## üìö Table of Contents
- [SQL](#sql)
- [Tableau](#tableau)
- [Python](#python)

## SQL <a name="sql"></a>
| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| [üõç Online Retail Sales and Customer Data](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Online%20Retail%20Sales%20Project) | EDA & Data Transformation | Utilized SQL queries to extract insights on product popularity, seasonal revenue, top-selling items, sales trends by month and country, customer spending habits, and customer lifetime value. These insights enable informed inventory management and personalized marketing strategies, enhancing overall business performance. |

## Tableau <a name="sql"></a>

| [üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Online Retail Sales Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/OnlineRetailSalesDashboard_17141246193480/Dashboard1) |  Developed an interactive dashboard featuring key metrics such as revenue, COGS, net profit, CLV profitability, seasonal revenue share, monthly trends, country revenue contributions over time, and a revenue per country heatmap. |


## Python <a name="python"></a>
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| [üíµ Data Scientist Salary Prediction](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Project) | Data Wrangling, EDA, Machine Learning Modeling | This project develops a machine learning model to predict salaries for data science roles globally. By analyzing factors like experience level, location, and employment type, it provides insights into compensation and areas for improvement. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction%20Project) | Machine Learning Modeling | In this project, I constructed three different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis) that predict the quality of wine with the chosen dataset which contains the physicochemical properties and sensory ratings of 4898 white wines and 1599 red wines from the north of Portugal. The goal is to predict the quality of the wine, which is scored between 0 and 10. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib |
| [ü¶† Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Project) | Data Wrangling, Data Transformation, EDA, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Visualization & Modeling | In this project, I conducted lengthy EDA, supervised, and unsupervised modeling to assess my running hypothesis which posits a positive correlation between changes in death rates and first-dose vaccination rates. It suggests that higher death rates could drive increased urgency for vaccination. | Pandas, Sklearn, Geopy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy |
